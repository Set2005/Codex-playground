{"summary":"Found a human-in-loop handling bug that will trigger incorrect concurrent tasks in interactive mode. No other issues spotted in this commit.","reviews":[{"file":"src/cli.js","line_start":355,"line_end":370,"severity":"high","category":"logic","message":"The same readline instance handles both normal commands (`rl.on('line')`) and human-in-loop prompts (`rl.question` in `onInterrupt`). When the agent asks for input, the user’s answer will also fire the existing `line` handler, so it gets treated as a new top-level command and starts another `runBrowserAgent` invocation while the original run is paused waiting for that answer. This will corrupt state or launch overlapping runs on every interrupt. Pause/disable the main listener or use a separate readline while collecting interrupt input."}]}
